[SAP recommends](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/update-on-the-sap-identity-management-migration-to-microsoft-entra/ba-p/13742820) its SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers transition to Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Microsoft Azure Active Directory) as the SAP IDM solution approaches the end of maintenance by 2027, with extended maintenance until 2030. This blog post series aims to provide technical guidance on how to plan and implement IAM for SAP applications with Microsoft Entra following [SAP's reference architecture](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/refArchDetail/ref-arch-cloud-leading-identity-lifecycle) for Cloud-leading identity lifecycle.
